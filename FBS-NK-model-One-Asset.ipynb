If the return on one asset is higher than all other assets than the mutual fund will only want to invest in the asset with the highest return. Supply of bonds, shares and reserves are inelastic here. Thus, prices of bonds and stocks are demand determined. The nominal interest rate on reserves is determined by the taylor rule. Assume we start in equilibrium where the return of all assets are equal. If the nominal interest rate were to fall, then managers return maximizing behavior would to shift all his resources to bonds or stocks. That is demand for both rises, however since supply is inelastically zero the prices of these assets must rise to clear the market. To reiterate, the mutual would like to put more of its funds $A_{t}$ towards stocks and bonds if the nominal rate falls,however they can't not purchase more since supply is inelastic leading the price to rise. If the interest were to rise, then the mutual fund would want to put its funds into reserves.

For labor unions that cannot raise their wage, they  In the limit, the firms who could not initially change their price , will eventually be able to change their price and increase their dividend. This is taken into account by the market and so the expectations of the dividend for all firms rises after the shock. Thus, both an increase in expectations of dividends and a fall in the discount rate will raise the stock price of all firms by different degrees.
