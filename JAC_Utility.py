    Given n lists (or tuples) whose elements represent n independent, discrete

    all combinations of these independent points.  Can take multivariate discrete
    distributions as inputs.
    Parameters
    ----------
    distributions : [np.array]
        Arbitrary number of distributions (pmfs).  Each pmf is a list or tuple.
